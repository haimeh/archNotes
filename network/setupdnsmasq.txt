DNSMASQ related setup

pacman -S dnsmasq

/etc/dnsmasq.conf
add: listen-address=127.0.0.1
note: if using resolvconf
      add: no-resolv
           conf-file=/etc/dnsmasq-conf.conf
           resolv-file=/etc/dnsmasq-resolv.conf

/etc/resolv.conf
add: nameserver 127.0.0.1
note: this is not necissary if using resolvconf

/etc/dhcpcd.conf
add: nohook resolv.conf
     static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8
note: dhcpcd executes all scripts in /usr/lib/dhcpcd-hooks/ but each script can be disabled via "nohook scriptnamehere" OR
      IF USING RESOLVCONF
      notthese
      {
      /etc/resolv.conf.head
      add: static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
      note: in this way resolvconf preappends these to /etc/resolv.conf
      OR
      /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head
      add: nameserver 8.8.8.8
      }
      
      dns servers can be added to /etc/resolvconf.conf:
      add: name_servers="::1 127.0.0.1"
           # Write out dnsmasq extended configuration and resolv files
           dnsmasq_conf=/etc/dnsmasq-conf.conf
           dnsmasq_resolv=/etc/dnsmasq-resolv.conf
      and run resolvconv -u


/etc/resolv.dnsmasq.conf
add name servers (google):
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

/etc/dnsmasq.conf
add: resolv-file=/etc/resolv.dnsmasq.conf


DHCPCD related setup (must su)
note: if resolfconf is available, dns info is set to it rather than /etc/resolv.conf
echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" > /etc/resolv.conf.head



Finally we can enable dnsmasq

block adds

etc/dnsmasq.conf
addn-hosts=/file/with/hosts/to/block
or you can just append the names to /etc/hosts
